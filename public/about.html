    My name is Joseph J Nowakowski. I'm currently enrolled in the applied 
    associate degree program for Computer Information Systems at Luzerne
    County Community College. My current GPA for the program is 3.8. 
    I'm a member of the Alpha Sigma Lambda chapter of the national honor 
    society. I'm also a member of the National Society of Leadership and 
    Success.

    My plans after graduation are to continue my education online at Western 
    Governor's University. I plan to pursue a bachelor's degree in Software
    Engineering in the Java programming track. My dream job is to work remotely
    as a software engineer with the Python programming language.

    In my spare time, I enjoy playing video games, golfing, hiking, watching movies, and reading(most likely, 
    books on philosophy or Spirituality). I'm currentlly working through a Web Development Bootcamp
    on Udemy.com (this website is actually a project from the course!) I'm also working through a 
    tutorial on how to create a DOOM-style first-person shooter game in Python using the Pygame engine
    on Youtube.
